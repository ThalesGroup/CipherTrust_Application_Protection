## Prerequisites

- All the Java samples are compiled and tested using JDK version 1.8.0_111 on Linux and Windows.

To run PKCS11 Java Samples :

- The minimum Java version must be 8 (minimum 1.8.0_111).
- CADP for C library must be installed.
- cadp-pkcs11-wrapper-2.0 Jar must be in the classpath or added in java command using "-cp".
- Add CADP for C PKCS11 Library Path inside Helper.java sample. If Library path is not updated in Helper.java it can be provided as an input for the samples using [-m module] attribute or it will use the default library path.
- In linux properties file needs to be exported using command "export NAE_Properties_Conf_Filename=/*path to property file*/CADP_PKCS11.properties" if CADP for C is not installed on default path. 
- In windows Property file should be placed parallel to the library file.

## CADP for C PKCS11 Library Path (Default Path)

The default path for the CADP for C PKCS11 library in Windows is the following:

    C:\Program Files\CipherTrust\CADP_for_C\libcadp_pkcs11.dll

The default path for the CADP for C PKCS11 library in Linux is the following:

    /opt/CipherTrust/CADP_for_C/libcadp_pkcs11.so


## How to Run the Code Samples

This section provides instructions on how to view the sample usage information and run the PKCS11 Java Samples in Windows and Linux. For Linux, additional information is provided on how to set the path of the CADP_PKCS11.properties file through an environment variable (if required).

### Windows & Linux

#### Running Code Samples
Go to the src directory placed inside custom_wrapper or sun_pkcs11 according to your requirement for samples.

Run the following command to run the CreateKey.java sample from custom_wrapper:

#### To Compile â€“ 
javac -cp .;cadp-pkcs11-wrapper-2.0.jar com\vormetric\pkcs11\sample\Helper.java  com\vormetric\pkcs11\sample\CreateKey.java

#### To Run - 
java -cp .;cadp-pkcs11-wrapper-2.0.jar com.vormetric.pkcs11.sample.CreateKey

    Note: On Linux replace ';' with ':' in -cp attribute and '\' with '/'.
    Note: Replace cadp-pkcs11-wrapper-2.0.jar with the complete path of cadp-pkcs11-wrapper-2.0.jar or place the jar in current directory.


In a similar fashion, you can run other java samples.


## Viewing Sample Usage Information

Before running the code samples in Windows, learn how to run a sample by viewing its usage information (if you do not already know how to do so). To view usage information about a given sample, enter the name of the executable sample file from the directory in which the executable files are located. For example:

java -cp .;cadp-pkcs11-wrapper-2.0.jar com.vormetric.pkcs11.sample.Helper  com.vormetric.pkcs11.sample.CreateKey usage

The following displays: 

usage: java [-cp CLASSPATH] com.cadp.pkcs11.sample.CreateKey -p pin [-k keyName] [-m module] [-g gen_key_action]

-p: Username: Password of CipherTrust Manager
-k: Keyname on CipherTrust Manager
-m: Path of directory where library (Dll) is deployed/installed
-g: ...0 for versionCreate, 1 for versionRotate, 2 for versionMigrate, 3 for nonVersionCreate

## Ant Build

In linux properties file needs to be exported using command "export NAE_Properties_Conf_Filename=/*path to property file*/CADP_PKCS11.properties" if CADP for C is not installed on default path. 

In windows Property file should be placed parallel to the library file.

### Build:

You need ant to build the samples.

Update Library path in Helper.java placed inside custom_wrapper/src/com/vormetric/pkcs11/sample/Helper.java

Move to the directory where build.xml resides. i.e Inside customer_wrapper or sun_pkcs11.

To run all the sample programs altogether, please first modify the following line in build.xml, property name="wrapper.jar" value="cadp-pkcs11-wrapper-2.0.jar", replace cadp-pkcs11-wrapper-2.0.jar with the complete path of cadp-pkcs11-wrapper-2.0.jar or place the jar in current directory.

If you are using Java 11 or newer then modify the following line in build.xml, property name="jaxb.jar" value="jaxb-api-2.3.1.jar", replace jaxb-api-2.3.1.jar with the complete path of jaxb-api-2.3.1.jar or place the jar in current directory.

To compile the sample files, simply type 'ant compile' in the terminal or cmd of directory.

### Execution 
To run all the sample programs altogether, please first modify the following line in build.xml,
property name="PIN" value="username:password"/
replace "username:password" with the credentials you used to register with the CipherTrust Manager, then simply type 'ant' in the terminal or cmd of directory.
