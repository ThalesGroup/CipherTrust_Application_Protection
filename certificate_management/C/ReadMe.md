## Overview

CADP for C supports Certificate Management using NAE protocol for communication with the Key Manager server.

For API details, refer to the NAE Certificate Management API section in the CADP for C API Guide. To use NAE with CADP for C, you must set the NAE_IP, NAE_Port, Protocol, and CA_File parameters in the properties file.

**Important!** Additional parameters can be set for additional features. To use the NAE Certificate Management features, the Protocol parameter should be set to ssl.

For details on NAE parameters, refer to "Configuration" page in the CADP for C user guide.

## How to Compile Sample Applications

Included with the CADP for C software are sample C/C++ files, the source code for sample applications that you can use to test your installation.

>*To compile the sample application on **Windows**:*

1. Navigate to `<installation_Directory>` i.e., C:\Program Files\CipherTrust\CADP_for_C\.

2. Copy "C" directory of sample applications (CipherTrust_Application_Protection\certificate_management\C) to `<installation_Directory>`.

3. Navigate to `<installation_Directory>\C\VC`

4. Open the `sample.sln` file in Visual Studio 2022.

5. Select a sample project and build it.

>*To compile the sample application on **Linux**:*

You can compile this with a C++ or C compiler such as gcc (4.8.x or higher). If you have an older gcc or another C compiler, you may need to obtain libstdc++.so.6 and possibly libgcc_s.so.

1. Navigate to the Sample Directory. For example, `<CipherTrust_Application_Protection/key_management/C>`.

2. Open Makefile.

3. Update the path of the variable `CAPILIBPATH`, if required. The default path is the default installation directory.
```
   CAPILIBPATH := /opt/CipherTrust/CADP_for_C/
```
4. Save and close the Makefile.

5. Run make command.
```
   [root@machine C]# make
```
6. Run a sample with valid arguments.
```
   [root@machine C]# ./NAECertificateManagement -h
```

## Sample Applications

Sample applications to demonstrate the use of NAE Certificate Management.

**NAE Certificate Management Sample Application**

The NAE Certificate Management sample application supplied with CADP for C is:

Application|Description
---|---
NAECertificateManagement.c | Performs import certificate operation. Creates a certificate on Key Manager.

## Limitations

* ModifyAttribute operation supports limited attributes. Only the String and DateTime attributes are currently supported.
* Locate operation using wild cards and regular expressions is not supported.
