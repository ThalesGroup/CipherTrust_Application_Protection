================================================================================

CADP for C v8.13.0.000 supports Key Management using KMIP protocol for 
communication with the KMIP server. Currently, only the following managed 
objects are supported: Symmetric Key, Template, and Secret Data.

For API details, refer to the KMIP Key Management API section in the CADP for C 
API Guide. To use KMIP with CADP CAPI, you must set the KMIP_Spec_File,
KMIP_IP, KMIP_Port, Protocol, and CA_File parameters in the 
properties file.

Important! Additional parameters can be set for the additional features. To use the 
KMIP Key Management features, the Protocol parameter should be set to ssl.
For details on NAE parameters, refer to "Configuration" page in the CADP for C user guide.

              --- :: HOW TO COMPILE SAMPLE APPLICATIONS :: ---
================================================================================

Included with the CADP for C v8.13.0.000 software are sample C/C++ files, the
source code for sample applications that you can use to test your installation. 
To compile the sample application on Windows:

1. Navigate to <installation_Directory> i.e., C:\Program Files\CipherTrust\CADP_for_C\.

2. Copy C directory of samples which is downloded from github.

3. Navigate to <installation_Directory>\C\VC\.

4. Open the `sample.sln` file in Visual Studio 2010.

5. Select a sample project and build it.


To compile the sample application on Linux:

1. Navigate to <installation_Directory>. For example, 
   consider that <installation_Directory> is /opt/CipherTrust/CADP_for_C/

2. Copy C directory of samples which is downloded from github.

3. Navigate to <installation_Directory>/C/.

4. Run make command.

5. Run a sample with valid arguments.

                             --- :: LIMITATIONS :: ---
================================================================================

 - If KMIP is configured (by configuring the KMIP_IP parameter in the properties
   file), using I_C_OpenSession with the I_T_Auth_Password parameter returns 
   failure.  

   You can use the I_T_AuthNoPassword parameter for no credential support.
   To use Credential Base object, the I_T_Auth_KMIP parameter is used.

 - Register Template operations using an existing template name are not 
   supported.

 - Create operation does not support HMAC algorithms and key creation from 
   template.

 - ModifyAttribute operation supports limited attributes. Only the String and 
   DateTime attributes are currently supported.

 - Locate operation using wild cards and regular expressions is not supported.
