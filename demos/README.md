## Overview

`Projects inside this folder are there to help developers who are building applications that commonly require policy driven data protection to meet some compliance requirement, or for any other purpose. Idea is to showcase how easy it is to leverage various CipherTrust Application Data Protection products in your own products. You may choose to pick and choose code as is or customize to your needs.`

This repository will hold code samples and/or integrations that you can use in your environment
