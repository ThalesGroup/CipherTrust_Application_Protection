# **Overview**

CADP Vaultless Tokenization performs the bulk tokenization/detokenization operations based on the configurations set in the migration.properties and detokenization.properties files.

* The migration.properties file is used for file-to-file tokenization of bulk data involving both plaintext and
encrypted texts.
* The detokenization.properties file is used for file-to-file detokenization of tokens.

Both the files are categorised based on the input type of input file i.e.       
* Positional
* Delimited

These properties files are largely self-documenting. Open these files to become familiar with the capabilities and usage
of bulk migration utility provided by CADP Vaultless Tokenization.

> Sample input file is available for both the input type.
