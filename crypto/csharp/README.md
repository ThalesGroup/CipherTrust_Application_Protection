# Integration/Sample Code for C#/.NET Core

## Overview
The following samples show how to perform crypto operations with various ciphers, sign and verify data and much more.

* CryptoOpRijndael.cs
  * This sample shows how to perform *crypto operations* (Encrypt and Decrypt) using **AES** mode. 
* CryptoOpAesGcm.cs
  * This sample shows how to perform *crypto operations* (Encrypt and Decrypt) using **AES-GCM** mode.
* CryptoOpMacVerify.cs
  * This sample shows how to *generate and verify* a **MAC** .
* CryptoOpRSAEncDec.cs
  * This sample shows how to perform *crypto operations* (Encrypt and Decrypt) using a **RSA** key.
* CryptoOpRsaSignVerify.cs
  * This sample shows how to *sign data and verify signed data* using **RSA** key.
* CryptoMultiThreadedHmac.cs
  * This sample shows how to use multiple threads that share the same session and perform mac operations.*
* CryptoOpFpe.cs
  * This sample shows how to perform *crypto operations* (Encrypt and Decrypt) using **FPE**.
* CryptoOpECSignVerify.cs
  * This sample shows how to perform *sign data and verify signed data* using **EC** key.
* CryptoOpFpeWithEncoding.cs
  * This sample shows how to encrypt and decrypt data using FPE Unicode with different Encodings
* PersistentCachingSample.cs
  * This sample shows how to perform *crypto operations* using persistent cache.
  
## Prerequisites: 
In order to run C# samples, 
1. .NET 6.0 or higher must be installed.
1. CipherTrust.CADP.NETCore NuGet package must be installed.

## Usage: 
1. Create a console application. Let's say `SampleApp`.
1. From the available sample cs files, add anyone to the project.
1. Add the CipherTrust.CADP.NETCore NuGet package to the project and build using command `dotnet build -c Release`. To know more about NuGet package and how to add it, refer to [CipherTrust.CADP.NETCore](https://www.nuget.org/packages/CipherTrust.CADP.NETCore/).
1. Use either of the following commands to execute the project-
    * `dotnet run` command to run the project at a terminal prompt.
    * `dotnet` command to run `SampleApp.dll` at location `\bin\release\net6.0` using terminal. Example: `dotnet SampleApp.dll`
    * [Windows Only] `SampleApp.exe` at location `\bin\release\net6.0` using terminal. Example: `SampleApp.exe`
