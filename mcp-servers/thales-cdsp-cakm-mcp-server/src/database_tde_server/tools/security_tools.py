Database TDE security configuration tools

This module provides tools for configuring and managing security settings for Transparent Data Encryption (TDE)
operations. Database encryption and encryption key management are handled by Thales CipherTrust Application Key Management (CAKM)
connector, which is integrated with Thales CDSP (CipherTrust Data Security Platform).

Available tools:
- manage_sql_ekm_objects: Manage SQL Server EKM objects (providers, credentials, logins)
  - Operations: manage_ekm_providers, manage_credentials, manage_logins
  - Lists cryptographic providers and their capabilities
  - Manages server logins and credential mappings
  - Handles EKM object lifecycle and cleanup

        Manage SQL Server External Key Manager (EKM) objects.

        This tool handles the lifecycle of EKM providers, the credentials used to
        access them, and the server logins that are mapped to those credentials.

        Args:
            operation: The operation to perform. One of:
                - "manage_ekm_providers": List EKM cryptographic providers.
                - "manage_credentials": List, update, or drop credential objects.
                - "manage_logins": List or drop server login objects.
            sql_connection: The name of the database connection to use.
            login_name: Target login name for 'manage_logins' or 'fix_mappings' on credentials.
            credential_name: Target credential name for 'manage_credentials'.
            provider_name: (Future use) Target provider name.
            force: If true, forces dropping of objects that have dependencies.
            new_password: New password for updating a credential.
            ciphertrust_username: New CipherTrust username for updating a credential's identity.
            ciphertrust_domain: New CipherTrust domain for updating a credential's identity.
            show_mappings: If true, shows login-to-credential mappings when listing credentials.
            include_system: If true, includes system logins when listing.
            tde_only: If true, lists only TDE-specific logins.
            unused_only: If true, drops only unused TDE logins.

        Returns:
            A JSON string with the results of the operation.
